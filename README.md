### My Frontend Learning Path  ðŸš€

Hey, I'm Sasha. I'm a photographer and a doctor-anesthesiologist.  
Previously, I have learned the language of medicine and the language of visual expression.  
A year ago, I decided to learn another language of communication - programming in JavaScript.

#### IT for me is a real challenge
- I wonder how long my self-education will last
- I am curious to know how many interviews I'll get to find my first job
- I wonder how soon Iâ€™ll get my first IT offer.   

I started learning frontend development with [RS School](https://rs.school/) from scratch in December 2022.  
And during three monthes I was feeling like ...

I have finished [pre-stage level](https://rs.school/js-stage0/) in march 2023 - [certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZRelM6z8ZRbNunmKGkNIQZ4tFI-uW52y/view?usp=drive_link).

But in one month of Stage 1 I gave up ... but I didn't finish learning JS.

During half of the year I have continued with Codewars, Microsoft, freeCodeCamp, and now it is my second try in RS School.
